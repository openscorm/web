/**
 * Block, never flex.
 *
 * An input has no children to lay out, so flex changes nothing for a text box - but a date or time
 * input renders its spinner fields and calendar button in a shadow tree the page cannot reach, and
 * Chrome lays that tree out as flex items when the input itself is display:flex. The calendar
 * button then sits hard against the border while the text is inset 12px. Block puts it back inside
 * the padding.
 *
 * Fixing it here rather than in a stylesheet is the point: a rule in @layer base cannot win against
 * a utility class on the element, which is why the first attempt at this did nothing.
